						This event consists of 2 rounds. The first round will be an ordinary competitive programming
						round where the contestants will be given a desktop application and a PDF (for the second
						member of the team). The questions will be the same in the App and in the pdf.
					</p>
					<p>
						The contestants are required to solve the questions and enter the output in the application
						which will be tested. A correct answer will award the team a certain number of points which is
						predetermined based on the difficulty of the question. The top 8 - 10 teams qualify for the final
						round.
					</p>
					<p>
						The second round will have a new concept of Super Powers. Each time is again presented with
						questions and PDFs like earlier. Super Powers will be earned by teams by solving a question/ set
						of questions. A Super Power can be used to be advantageous to the user. For example; a super
						power may let the user replace a medium question with an easy question, or will allow the user
						to freeze (stop coding) for a certain period of time.
					</p>
					<p>
						A random Super Power will be given to each team at the beginning of the round and can be
						used only 15 minutes after the commencement of the event. A Super Power can be achieved by
						solving a certain question/ set of questions (based on difficulty).
						The final results will be based on the total number of points scored.
